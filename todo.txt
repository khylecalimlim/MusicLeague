Weekly Player Data Stuff 
- Find out the song(s) that was the easiest to guess
- Find out the song(s) that was the hardest to guess
- Determine the player with the most correct guesses
- Determine the player with the least correct guesses
- Determine the player that was guessed correctly the most
- Determine the player that was guessed incorrectly the most

* Note: Above I used the word "Determine" for data that is being stored in the PlayerData Objects
        and I used the words "Find out" for data that I still need to figure out how to parse using the data frame

Determine fun ways to display the information we have now formatted into objects
- This probably means using MatPlotLib to show graphs
    - Bar graph of the number of guesses people got correct (where the max of the graph is the number of songs submitted... or just 14)

- Create an output file to paste into the chat for specifics on Player's guesses
    - This might just be me printing each player info data

EXTRA STUFF:
    - Use Spotify API to collect more data about the playlist / songs
    - Incorporate Tensorflow... somehow... for some reason
